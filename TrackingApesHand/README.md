# Beyond response times: Tracking apes’ hand trajectory on a touchscreen
Friday, August 9, 2024, 10:00 – 11:00 by Raphaelle Malassis & Rayanne Martin

## DeepLabcut
During the workshop, you'll use DeepLabCut to track apes' hands by setting up the training of your own network.

## Trajectory Analysis
After using DeepLabCut, you'll analyze the hand trajectories by writing a Python script.
You will fill-in the HandTracking_Fill_In_The_Gap.py file with the help of the presenters Raphaëlle Malassis and Rayanne Martin.
